# Metasploit Ethical Penetration Testing
## Overview
This project simulates a penetration test on AeroTech, a multinational aeronautical corporation, to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before an actual attack occurs.

- Nmap Vulnerability Scanning: Used Nmap to scan for open ports and outdated services, identifying potential attack surfaces.
- Vulnerability Research: Leveraged Google Dorking, Exploit-DB, and Rapid7 to find known exploits for detected vulnerabilities.
- Metasploit Introduction: Explored Metasploit modules, including exploits, auxiliary tools, and post-exploitation features.
- Exploitation with Metasploit: Loaded and configured an exploit for VSFTPD 2.3.4, successfully gaining unauthorised access to the victim machine.
- Establishing Persistence: Created a backdoor account to maintain access, highlighting the importance of monitoring unauthorised system modifications.
